Technical Brief: DeFi dApp Integration with Uniswap v3/v4

Goals:

Develop a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that integrates Uniswap v3/v4 to enable advanced liquidity management and automated trading strategies. The dApp will allow users to efficiently provide liquidity, perform swaps, and earn fees while interacting with Uniswap pools programmatically.

Target Ecosystem:

- Ethereum mainnet

- EVM-compatible chains (e.g., Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum)

Success Metrics:

- Smart contract deployment: Fully deployed and verified contracts on target chains

- Front-end hosting: dApp front-end deployed and publicly accessible

- Test coverage: Close to 100% coverage on unit and integration tests

- Integration with Uniswap hooks: Full functional interaction with selected Uniswap v3/v4 hooks

DeFi Focus:

This project focuses exclusively on DeFi applications, enabling liquidity provision, automated market-making, and token swaps. It leverages Uniswap v3/v4 features to enhance capital efficiency and provide users with a seamless DeFi experience.

Shortlist of Uniswap v3/v4 Hooks:

Swap: Facilitate token swaps within the dApp for end-users

Mint: Programmatic liquidity provisioning to Uniswap v3/v4 pools

Burn: Liquidity removal with fee collection and optimization strategies

Collect: Automated collection of accrued fees from liquidity positions
